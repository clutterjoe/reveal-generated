<p>Aten is a digital strategy, design and development agency in Denver, CO. We work with cause-driven organizations that are impacting people's lives around the world. We work with some amazing organizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Human Rights Watch</li>
	<li>Stanford University</li>
	<li>World Wildlife Fund</li>
	<li> ...to name a few.</li>
</ul>
<p>We like to think of ourselves as technology independent, but we use Drupal in most of our projects, and are heavily involved in the Drupal community.</p>

<p>Several years ago we saw an opportunity to work with some fantastic clients by supporting their online presence. Developing and extending sites we didnâ€™t build became its own discipline and required its own business model, and internal processes.</p>

<p>We wanted to come to BADCamp to share some of the growing pains and insights we gained as we built our support line of service and also to underscore the importance of ongoing development after launch.</p>
